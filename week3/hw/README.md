# Homework 3: Playing with Koa and React

## Introduction

This week, your goal is to create a React application that allows a user to log in via Google SSO [(learn more about SSO, or _single sign-on_)](https://blog.capterra.com/single-sign-on/) and then displays all of the user's Google Drive files.

To accomplish this, it helps to consider the different parts of what your code needs to look like. You need a React component to display some sort of login button to the user, Koa functionality to log a user in via Google SSO once that button is clicked, some more Koa functionality to retrieve the user's Google Drive files, and another React component to display those files in a nice format.

Here are the tools we'll be using to complete this assignment:

- [Koa](https://koajs.com) to handle server-side functionality
- [React](https://reactjs.org) to handle building your frontend, along with HTML and CSS
  - [MDN's guide to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
  - [MDN's guide to CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
- [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org) to make user SSO really simple
- [Google Drive REST API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk) to interact with Google Drive
